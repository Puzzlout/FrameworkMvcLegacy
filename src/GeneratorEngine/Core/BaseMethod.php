/**
 * Base class for class methods generation.
 * A method is made of:
 *    - an accessor: private, public, protected
 *    - a static keyword
 *    - a name: as descriptive as possible!
 *    - a set of parameters: max. 5! If you find yourself having more than 5, consider creating a class containing all those parameters.
 *    - a return value type: PHP 5.6 and below don't handle return type hinting but PHP 7.0 will so why not anticipate?
